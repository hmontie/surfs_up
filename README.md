# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this Surf's Up analysis was to determine different weather statistics for summer and winter months in Hawaii, the intended location of a potential surf and icecream shop. Based on this weather analysis we can determine ideal months for surfing and icecream consumption and inform business strategies.

## Results

- The June temperature analysis indicates the average monthly temperature is 74.9 (F), the monthly max temperature is 85.0 (F) and the monthly min temperature is 64.0 (F).

- The December temperature analysis indicates the average monthly temperature is 71.0 (F), the monthly max temperature is 83.0 (F) and the monthly min temperature is 56.0 (F).

- Please see full December summary stats: December Summary Stats

- The standard deviation in the June temperatures is slightly smaller (3.26) compared to the standard deviation in the December temperature (3.75), this impacts temperature ranges and temperature fluxuation. The range of temperatures in June are smaller and therefore warmer compared to the range of temperatures in Decemeber, which are larger and therefore colder.

## Summary 

- Comparing the two different months with these descriptive statistics suggestes the average temperatures are fairly similar between the summer (June) month and winter (December) month. However the ranges of temperatures in June are quite warmer compared to the ranges of temperature in Decemeber, which are colder.

- An additional query I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December would be level of precipitation for the different months, to compare rain in summer and winter seasons. Precipitation levels would impact surfing and icecream uptake and business operations.

- Another query I would perform would be, indicators of extreme weather events, it would be interesting to note if hurricanes, cyclones, tsunamis and other extreme weather events were more likley to occur in summer or winter months. This will be helpful for natural distaster safety planning.
